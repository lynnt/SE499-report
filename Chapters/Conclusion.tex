\chapter{Conclusion}
New extensions are written to support switching between tasks - a new
high-level construct introduced to \uCPP and new hooks are added to GNU
Debugger to support \CFAS demangler. GDB provides sufficient tools to extend
their product with Python extension API and hooks to add debugging support for a
new source language. In particular, writing Python extensions is easier and more
robust. The usage of Python language enables writing of
more complex operations with built-in data structures and functions.
Furthermore, GDB provides sufficient hooks to make it easier for a new language to leverage existing
infrastructure and codebase to add debugging support.
