\chapter{Conclusion}
New GDB extensions are created to support information display and touring among
\uCPPS user tasks, and new hooks are added to the GNU Debugger to support a
\CFAS demangler. The GDB extensions are implemented using the Python API, and
the hooks to add debugging support for \CFAS are implemented using \uCPPS. For
the GDB extensions, writing Python extensions is easier and more robust.
Furthermore, GDB provides sufficient hooks to make it possible for a new
language to leverage existing infrastructure and codebase to add debugging
support. The result provides significantly new capabilities for examining and
debugging both \uCPPS and \CFAS programs.
