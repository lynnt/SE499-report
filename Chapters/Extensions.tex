\chapter{Extending GDB for \uCPP}


\textcolor{red}{TODO}
\begin{itemize}
\item Summary design at a high level
\item Describe what design does and how it works along with a scenario for its
use case
\item Use subsections to guide through details of design
\item Start with a section with block diagram that shows major functions/layout
of design
\item Evaluate how the solution works by evaluating the design against
requirements you outlined in problem definition section.
\item State how the project should move ahead
\end{itemize}

As mentioned in chapter \ref{GDB}, there are many ways to extend GDB. However,
it is best if the selected mechanism is simple, easy to implement and yet
versatile.

Using Python extensions is a good solution for extending GDB given the criteria.
GDB provides a more extensive API for Python to work with. Additionally, Python
is a scripting language with built-in data structures and functions, which make
it more versatile and easy to work with.

As mentioned in chapter \ref{uCPP}, there are concepts such as clusters and
virtual processors in \uCPP. It is useful to have built-in GDB commands to list
all the existing clusters and virtual processors. This enables developers an
opportunity to understand what is going on in the system, and it is also the
entry point for switching between tasks.
