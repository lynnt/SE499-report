\chapter{Extending GDB for \uCPP}

\textcolor{red}{TODO}
\begin{itemize}
\item Summary design at a high level
\item Describe what design does and how it works along with a scenario for its
use case
\item Use subsections to guide through details of design
\item Start with a section with block diagram that shows major functions/layout
of design
\item Evaluate how the solution works by evaluating the design against
requirements you outlined in problem definition section.
\item State how the project should move ahead
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Constraints}
As mentioned in chapter \ref{GDB}, there are many ways to extend GDB. However,
it is best if the selected mechanism is simple, easy to implement and yet
versatile.

Using Python extensions is a good solution for extending GDB given the criteria.
GDB provides a more extensive API for Python to work with. Additionally, Python
is a scripting language with built-in data structures and functions, which make
it more versatile and easy to work with.

As mentioned in chapter \ref{uCPP}, there are concepts such as clusters and
virtual processors in \uCPP. It is useful to have built-in GDB commands to list
all the existing clusters and virtual processors. This provides developers
a mechanism to understand what is going on in the system. Furthermore, when users
press Ctrl-C or a failure occurs when running a \uCPPS program, one does not
know which task the program is in, and which cluster that task falls into. It is
useful to be able see this information.

\section{Design Implementation}
Seven user-defined commands are implemented as an extension in GDB for \uCPP.
