\section{Introduction}
\CCS \cite{reference10} extends the \CCS programming language with new mechanism to
facilitate control flow, and adds new objects to enable lightweight concurrency
on uniprocessor and parallel execution on multiprocessor. Concurrency has tasks
that can context switch, which is a control transfer from one execution state to
another one, and waiting tasks are selected to run on a processor if the current
task needs to wait for an occurrence of an event.

\section{Tasks}
A \textcolor{ForestGreen}{task} behaves like a class object, but it maintains its own
thread and execution state, which is the state information required to allow
independent executions. A task provides mutual exclusion by default for its
public members. Public members allow communication among tasks.

\section{\uCPPS Runtime Structure}
\uCPPS introduces two new runtime entities for controlling concurrent execution:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cluster
    \item Virtual processor
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cluster}
A cluster is a group of tasks and virtual processor (discussed next) that
execute tasks. The objective of a cluster is to control the amount of possible
parallelism, which is only feasible if there are many multiprocessors, among tasks.

At the start of a \uCPPS program, two clusters are created. One is the system
cluster and the other is the user cluster. The system cluster has a
processor that only performs management work such as error detection and
correction from user clusters if an execution in a user cluster results errors,
and properly cleans up when a shutdown occurs. The user cluster manages and
executes user tasks on its processors. The benefits of clusters
are maximized utilization of processors and miminization of runtime by selecting
a scheduler that is appropriate for the particular workload. Tasks and virtual
processors may be mitigated between clusters.

\subsection{Virtual Processor}
A virtual processor is a software emulation of a processor that executes
threads. Kernel threads are used to implement a virtual processor, which are
scheduled for execution on a hardware processor by the underlying operating
system. The operating system distributes kernel threads across a number of
processors assuming that the program runs on a multiprocessor architecture. The
usage of kernel threads enables parallel execution in \uCPP.
