Similar to \CC, C is a popular programming language especially in systems such
as operating systems, embedded systems. For example, Windows NT kernel and
Linux kernel are written in C, and they are the foundation of many higher level
and popular projects. Therefore, it is unlikely that they will go away any time soon.

However, C has in syntactics, linkage, semantics and many
more. Even though \CCS is meant to fix these problems, \CCS has legacy design
choices that cannot be undone and newer versions of \CCS require significantly
more effort to convert C-based projects into \CCS.

To solve this problem, \CFAS is designed by the programming language group at the
University of Waterloo. The language's goal is to extend C with modern language
features that many new languages have been known for such as Rust, Go. This
extension provides a backward compatible version of C while fixing existing
problems known in C.
