\chapter{\CFAS Demangler} \label{demangler}

\section{Design Constraints}
While \CFAS is a translator for additional features that C does not support, all
the code during the compilation phase is eventually compiled down to C code.
The resulting executable file marks the DWARF tag \verb|DW_AT_language| with the
fixed hexadecimal value for the C language. Because it is possible to have one frame in C code and another
frame in Assembly code, GDB encodes a language flag for each frame. \CFAS adds
to this list, as it is essential to know when a stack frame contains mangled
names C and assembler unmangled names. Thus, the first requirement is
making GDB understands \CFAS as a source language.

Next, there is a DWARF reader component in GDB since most GDB targets use the DWARF
format. The DWARF reader sets all the appropriate information read from object or
executable files in DIE structures within GDB as mentioned in Chapter
\ref{GDB}. However, GDB currently does not understand the DWARF language code
assigned to the
language \CFA, so another requirement is updating the DWARF reader in GDB to
recognize \CFA.

Additionally, when a user enters a name into GDB, GDB needs to lookup if the
name exists in the program. However, different languages may have different
hierarchical structure for dynamic scope, so an implementation for nonlocal
symbol lookup is required.

\section{Design Implementation}
Most of the implementation work discussed below is from reading GDB's internals
wiki page and understanding how other languages are supported in GDB \cite{reference5}.

A new entry is added to GDB's list of language definition in
\verb|gdb/defs.h|. Hence, a new instance of type \verb|struct language_def|
must be created to add a language definition of \CFAS. This instance is the
entry point for new functions that are only applicable to \CFA. These new
functions are invoked by GDB during debugging if there are operations that
are applicable specifically to \CFA. For instance, \CFAS can implement its
own symbol lookup function for non-local variables because \CFAS can have a
different scope hierarchy. The final step for registering \CFAS in GDB, as a new
source language, is adding the instance of type \verb|struct language_def| into
the list of language definitions, which can be found in
\verb|gdb/language.h|.

The next step is updating the DWARF reader, so the reader can translate the DWARF code to an enum value defined
above. However, this assumes that the language has an assigned language code.
The language code is a hexadecimal literal value assigned to a particular
language, which is maintained by GCC. For \CFA, the hexidecimal value
\verb|0x0025| is added to \verb|include/dwarf2.h| to denote \CFA.

Finally, the demangler implementation goes into the \verb|libiberty| directory along with
other demanglers. The demangler can be called by updating the language
definition defined above with the entry point of the \CFAS demangler.
In addition to the demangler, GDB provides an option
to manually set which demangler style to use in the command line interface.
This option can be turned on for \CFAS in GDB by adding a new enum value for \CFAS in
the list of demangling styles along with setting the appropriate mask for this
style in \verb|include/demangle.h|. After doing this step, users can now choose
if they want to use the \CFAS demangler in GDB by calling \verb|set demangle-style <language>|.

\section{Result}
The addition of hooks throughout GDB enables the invocation of the new \CFAS demangler, however, as the
language develops, symbol lookup for non-local variables must be implemented to
produce the correct output.
